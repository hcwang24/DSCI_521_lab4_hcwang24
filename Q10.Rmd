# Pythagorean theorem

Let's show how Pythagorean theorem is calculated.
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

---

# Example 1
Suppose the two legs have lengths 3 and 4, calculate the length of the hypotenuse.

```{r eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)
```

---

# Example 2
Suppose one of the legs has lengths 3 and the hypotenuse has length 5, what's the length of the other leg?

```{r eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
sqrt(5^2 - 3^2)
```
